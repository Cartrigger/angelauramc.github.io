## OptiFine
OptiFine, previously known as Optimine and OptiFog; is a Minecraft modification created by sp614x, Insecs, Payton147 and lacuravivid in which the development began on December 22, 2010; was a modification originally created about pushing the fog away but also other features; like FPS Boost, Occlussion Culling, Hidden Geometry removal, Texture Mipmaping and Chunk Loading optimizations in the first development/beta versions of Minecraft
