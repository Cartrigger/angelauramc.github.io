# Supported Minecraft versions

With each new Minecraft release comes the question: *Will it play nice with Amethyst?*

Thanks to the hard work from AngelAuraMC, the MobileGL organization, and countless contributors, both the Android and the iOS port cover most Minecraft versions...

...with some small exceptions.

## Android
1.0:
- 3d shareware build is broken with gl4es due to shader compilation errors.

## iOS
1.0:
- 1.21.6 and later require switching to MobileGlues
